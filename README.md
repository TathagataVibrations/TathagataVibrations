- 👋 Hi, I’m @TathagataVibrations
- 👀 I’m interested in politics, sciences, spirituality.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html/css
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creation of my website Participative Democracy. A place to vote laws. A place to have information about laws, their impact, and what laws could be voted to ensure a good politic. Then we will have information to compare and choose more wisely laws, and develop critical mind about laws that have been chosen, that will help to create better laws or predict how laws impact society. That should be a science and it still isn't a serious science though its impacting life of all people of earth ...

- 😄 Pronouns: I'm a male, im not participating to this fucking trash practice of having pronouns. This time is doomed tbh. I feel i'm a male because i have a dick and am not overthinking about it, I feel comfortable with that, its simplier like that, and am happy to find women attractive. I feel bad for people who are obsessed about gender, I accept every people as they are, but please stop making this practice a central and shared subject. We have enough problems in the world. If you are gender fluid, its fine too.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am not fun sorry :p
