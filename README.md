- 👋 Hi, I’m @TathagataVibrations
- 👀 I’m interested in politics, sciences, spirituality.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html/css
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creation of my website Participative Democracy. A place to vote laws. A place to have information about laws, their impact, and what laws could be voted to ensure a good politic. Then we will have information to compare and choose more wisely laws, and develop critical mind about laws that have been chosen, that will help to create better laws or predict how laws impact society. That should be a science and it still isn't a serious science though its impacting life of all people of earth ...(when its not dictature)
